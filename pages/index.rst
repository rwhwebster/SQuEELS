SQuEELS v0.1.6
====

SQuEELS (**S**\tandard-based **Qu**\antification of **EELS** data) is a package for in-depth analysis of elemental quantification of EELS core-loss spectra.

The SQuEELS package is designed to provide code for straightforward implementation of compositional quantification using reference spectra.  The code is intended to be easily inspected and understood, removing the ambiguity of black-box style operations found in Gatan DigitalMicrograph and Hyperspy.  SQuEELS is geared towards not only providing accurate quantification, but also enabling in-depth analysis of the errors and uncertainties of fitting procedures, to engender better confidence in results.
